# Universe SPA

This repository contains the source code for a responsive Single Page Application (SPA) named "Universe". The application is designed to be fully responsive, providing an optimal viewing and interaction experience across a wide range of devices, from desktop computers to mobile phones and tablets.

The main file, index.html, serves as the entry point of the application. It includes references to the application's JavaScript and CSS files, as well as Google Fonts for typography. The HTML structure includes a navigation menu with links to "Home", "The Universe", and "Exploration" sections. The onclick attribute on these links is used to handle routing in the SPA.

The application's content is dynamically loaded into the div with the id app. This approach allows for a seamless user experience, with no page reloads as the user navigates through the application.

Node.js Serverless Function wasn't done in this project, but it is functional in local.
