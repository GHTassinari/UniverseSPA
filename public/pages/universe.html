  <h1>The Universe</h1>
  <p class="textUniverse">
    The word Universe derives from the Latin universum. The Latin word was used
    by Cicero and later by other authors with the same meaning that is employed
    today. The Latin word is derived from the poetic contraction unvorsum—first
    used by Lucretius in Book IV of his “On the Nature of Things”—which connects
    un, uni (one) with vorsum, versum (which means "something turned, rolled, or
    changed").
