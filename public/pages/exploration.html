    Celestial bodies and stars have always been a source of great fascination
    for humanity. There are records of Greeks, Mesopotamians, and Aztecs
    describing various celestial events. In the contemporary era, several
    scientists have made significant contributions to making the dream of space
    exploration a reality, such as the Russian Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, the
    German Hermann Oberth, and the American Robert Goddard.
